# freelancing-market

A script build on custom php framework based on Laravel Eloquent ORM and Blade Template engine.

## Features

Employer: Post project, Hire freelancer, Make Payments
Employee: Submit proposal, Do work, Get Payments

## Current Development Status
We have already made a project for building MicroJob website(http://wpfreelancing.com/). We are re-building that to make it work for general Freelancing Marketplace where Hourly and Fixed price Job will be available.

#### Feature comparison than the MicroJob script:
 - Microjob Script build with concept to hire minimum 20 or more freelancers for a single job, where Freelancing Market will allow 1 or more people to hire.
 - Microjob Script allow anyone to complete and submit job. No selective hire available. In Freelancing Market, freelancer must be hire first before start work.
